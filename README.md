My first basic To Do App

After watching and reading a lot of content about javaScript it is time to build something... So here it is
This si not final product

I will implement edit button and improve style (css) of whole app

In this project is used:

adding EventListenerEvent on button, from there I will dynamically create li element.
I used innerHTML to set value of li element equal to input.value
That li element is appended in ol, and set classlist for that li.

Button for deleting the same li element is also created dynamically and appended to li element.
On this button EventListenerEvent is attached and li is deleted
